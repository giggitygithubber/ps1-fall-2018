                    <p>Everybody knows that filmmaking is supposed to be fun and as a means to establish a perspective on the big screen. 
                    Sadly, to actually make a film or write one, one must contend with a very competitive environment or risk investing vast 
                    amounts of money on gear, actors, etc. only to come up short from a lack of organization. Here among the Film Brotherhood 
                    with over 36 million subscribers with a small monthly fee of $5, this gives us 180 million yearly enable up to a $100,000 
                    budget per indie film (that's 1800 films a year, WOW!)
                        </p>
                    <p>As a noobie to the Brotherhood maybe all you want is to learn or hone your talents. Want to learn how to make your film, 
                    look into the class section. There are vasts amounts of tutorials (both our own and recommended with links) as well as 
                    livestream courses amongst our more veteran Brotherhood members. Want to be more hands on, we have a maps section that 
                    alerts you to ALL classes relating to studio and field filmmaking. Simply sign on our newsletter and with our mapping 
                    algorithm we will personally notify you of free classes CLOSEST to your location.</p>

                    <h3>What We Do?</h3>
                    <p><p>Our budgets are small because unlike in Hollywood Films where to pay a simple vfx costs a literal decapitated arm or 
                    resurrected corpse we pride ourselves on doing much more with less. Every prop is handmade, every actor is a willing paid 
                    volunteer, every writer and vfx artist are the talent you would normally gape on youtube whom do it in the comfort of their 
                    homes, we merely unite all of these talented individuals into one global roof. The world is our studio, and with the 
                    advancements of modern internet and social media this significantly reduces costs down to merely thousands what would 
                    normally costs millions.</p></p>
