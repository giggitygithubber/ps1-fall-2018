        <h1>Room and Board</h1>
        <p>Whether a newcomer or VIP here at <em>La Grande Toilette</em> our rooms hold a historical standing since 1850. As a means of preserving historical integrity we at the La Grande Toilette
            have forgone the need for upstanding to normal construction regulations. Our more artistic guests have found this style to be very "abstract" as a result, thus furthering our notoriety even in the srtistic world.
