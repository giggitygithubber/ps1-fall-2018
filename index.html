                <p>The Film Brotherhood has always been a non-corporate global film production union
                        dating as far back as 1978, inspired by George Lucas' film "Star Wars A New Hope". Our
                        mission revolves around aiding filmmakers in getting their ideas down on paper or put
                        on the big screen.
