                    <h1>History </h1>
                     <p>This prestigious establishment would not have been founded without the efforts of Harold P. Schlong. As far back in 1817, at the tender age of 
                         11, he came up with the idea for a "stay-in" business that would enable railroad workers either rest or to enable shipments of wood and steel to be shipped westward into the uncharted
                         territories into the west (the wild west specifically). This would become the focal trade center through which up and coming steel industries as well as the starter oil refineries were inspired through
                         the laymen whom conducted research there (though the technology for digging oil was not possible until after 1859). Due to his early wealth Harold funded 
                         the steel mill company known as "The Iron Rod" and "Ballaholic Steel Co." granting him the nickname 'Iron Schlong Harry'. He died early at 26 due to testicular fungal infection and had the name engraved on his tombstone. It's location is now unknown.
